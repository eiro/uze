# it ... 

# * is kinda poor man's xargs? zargs ?   
# * needs a better name (related to std or filter)

# anyway, it ..

# * append a command at the end of each lines
# * pipes to zsh 

# as example, if a file 'urls' contains
# http://foo.bar    > file1 
# http://foo.bang  >> file1
# http://bar.bar    > file2 
# http://bar.bang  >> file2 

#   pipe/to curl -ksL < urls 
# will create file1 and file2 

# this is very usefull from inside vim 

# BONUS: 

# tired to `:.!pipe/to foo`? 
# then try in your .zshenv:
# pipe/alias F foo 

# and in vim: `:.!F `

# warn "pipe/* are EXPERIMENTAL"
# pipe/to () { sed 's#^#$1 #' | zsh  } 
# pipe/alias () { eval "$1 () { $(cat) | zsh }" }
